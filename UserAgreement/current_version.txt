1. LegalAlienChatbot is an AI chatbot powered by Rasa Open Source. It is developed and operated by team TalkingHeads (Jeyana Morozenko, Nazli Dolu, Violetta Shishkina). It started in May 2021 as a study project for TechLabs Amsterdam.
2. We are not storing any of your data anywhere, and, naturally, we can not share it with any third parties.
3. We are doing our best to ensure that all the bot's messages are respectful, friendly and helpful, but do not guarantee that you'll be 100% happy with them. But then the same goes for humans ;)

Have fun!
